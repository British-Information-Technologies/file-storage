# File Storage Service

A very basic file storage solution, to overcome Discords file size limit.

Currently in its infancy, and I am working to add security measures.

But file uploads and downloads function.

File space is measured using 1024 byte blocks.

Any person can upload and download files.

## Plans
- User authentication, using unified BIT ID.
- Privacy and permissions, to add basic security.
- Folders, to organise contents.
- Per user space limits.
